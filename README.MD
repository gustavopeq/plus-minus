# Algorithm Plus-Minus
Project created to study and apply concepts of Time/Space complexity

## Definition
Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros.
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

## Complexity Time/Space
Time = O(N)  
Space = O(1)
